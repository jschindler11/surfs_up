## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze temperature data from June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round

## Results
* The average temperature in June is 75 degrees and the average temperature in December is 71 degrees
* The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees
* The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees and the maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees
* Despite June and December being peak months of opposite seasons (summer and winter, respectively), the average temperature only varies by 4 degrees
* There is a difference of 8 degrees between the minumum temperature in June and the minimum temperature in December, while there is a difference of only 2 degrees between the maximum temperature in June and the maximum temperature in December

## Summary
* Based off these findings, a surf and ice cream shop should be sustainable year round at this location. There might be a slight drop in sales during the winter, but not enough to jeopardize the profitability of the company.
* Being provided with a data set of temperatures at certain times of day will further refine this analysis. For instance, it gets a bit cold (56 degrees at the coldest) in December, but that is most likely during the early morning or late evening. The maximum temperature during December is 83 degrees, which probably comes mid-day.
* It would be interesting to perform a query that gives us the summary statistics broken down by each week in December. If this query finds one week to be particularly colder than the rest, the shop could shut down for that particular week to 1) minimize loses and 2) provide employees with well-deserved time off.
* It would be interesting to perform a query that gives us the summary statistics broken down by each week in June. If this query finds one week to be particularly hotter than the rest, the shop could extend its operating hours for that particular week to maximize profits.
